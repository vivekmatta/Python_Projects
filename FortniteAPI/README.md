These two python programs use an API from the website https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api
I created two programs:
1. The first one 'FortniteShop.py' checks the Fortnite Shop and brings back everything from the shop. I had to find out how 
to only print out certain parts of the API. When I figured it out, I printed out the: cost in v-bucks, name of item, and the 
link to the .PNG file. I haven't figured out yet how to output the image.
2. The second one 'FortniteKills.py' asks the user to enter what console they play on and what their Fortnite username is.
It then prints out how mayn kills you have in solo, duo and squads. 
If you have any advice on how to improve my code or how to output images, comment.
